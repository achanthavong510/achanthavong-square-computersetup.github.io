Square runs a __Device Attestation Service__ (DAS) that asks your device to present a certificate (like a passport when you enter a country) proving it is an authorized and Square-owned device. Next, try accessing the restricted __go/it__ link.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/go-it.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/go-it.jpg" %}

If your device's certificate is properly issued and valid, you should see the __IT Help Center__ shown above. This is where you would submit any help requests (called "tickets") should you have issues in the future. If everything seems to be working, [skip to the bottom](#done) of this page.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/das-trouble.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/das-trouble.jpg" %}

If you see __We're having trouble identifying your device__, it means your device did not present a valid certificate. Please join the new hire onboarding session or email Mission Control to get this resolved. Note: Please include the serial number of your laptop.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/das-update.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/das-update.jpg" %}

If you see __Looks like your device needs some maintenance__, it means your device has a valid certificate, but needs updates to the operating system. 

__NOTE:__ If today is your first day at Square, please run these updates during your lunch break and skip ahead to the next step for now.
