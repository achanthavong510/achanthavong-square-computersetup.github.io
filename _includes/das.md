Block operates a __Device Attestation Service__ (DAS) that requires your device to present a certificate, similar to a passport, proving it is an authorized and Block-owned device. To proceed, try accessing the restricted __go/registry__ link.

If your deviceâ€™s certificate is properly issued and valid, you should see the following page:
{% include figure url="/assets/images/das-registry.png" image_path="/assets/images/das-registry.png" %}
__You do not need to enter any information,__; you can __skip to the next step.__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/das-trouble.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/das-trouble.jpg" %}

If you see __We're having trouble identifying your device__, it means your device did not present a valid certificate. [Please contact IT for help, so you can access Block's systems correctly](/help)

{% include figure url="/assets/images/das-update.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/das-update.jpg" %}

If you see __Looks like your device needs some maintenance__, it means your device has a valid certificate, but needs some updates to the operating system.
