Your __temporary password__ will expire in 24 hours, and it is a security best practice to change it immediately after your first login. 

## Reset password

In your web browser, visit [passwords.sqprod.co](https://passwords.sqprod.co/){:target="_blank"}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-login2.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-login2.jpg" %}

Enter just your username (**without the** @squareup.com) and your __temporary__ password and click [Login](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/password1.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/password1.jpg" %}

Again, enter just your username (**without the** @squareup.com) and click [Submit](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/password2.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/password2.jpg" %}

Enter your __current temporary__ password followed by a __new password__ and then that same __new password__ again to verify your selection. The website will inform you of the password requirements. 

Then, click [Change Password](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}
