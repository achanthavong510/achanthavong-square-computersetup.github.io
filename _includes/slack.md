Here at Block, we use __Slack__ for instant messaging (chat) to enable quick communication within your team and across the company. 

By default, every user is added to our Block, Inc. Slack workspace.  This workspace includes all workspaces and channels for our various Business Units: 
- Block
- Cash App
- Square 
- TIDAL

Visit [square.enterprise.slack.com](https://square.enterprise.slack.com/){:target="_blank"} and choose the workspace most appropriate to your job role. 


Click on __Sign in with Block SSO__ which should redirect you to Okta where you can sign in with your Block username and Password. If you haven't used Slack before, please browse the [Slack quick start guide](https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/your-quick-start-guide-to-slack){:target="_blank"}.

You may be prompted to __Enable Desktop Notifications__:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" %}

These notifications will take the form of brief pop-ups in the corner of your screen. Click to allow notifications so that you don't miss any incoming messages.

As you'll interact with Slack daily, we recommend you __Pin__ Slack so that it is always available. Right-click on the web page tab at the top and select __Pin tab__, as illustrated below:
