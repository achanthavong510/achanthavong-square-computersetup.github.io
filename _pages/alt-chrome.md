Now that we have your DUO setup and your Password Reset, we are going to setup Google Chrome on your computer to use Block's *go/links.

> go/ links are shortcuts to access various sites and tools in the Block ecosystem. For example, go/workday takes you to the Block Workday space. You’ll see these referenced throughout the onboarding guides and emails from Block. You can access go/ links from Chrome but only after successfully logging into your Block account as a profile in Chrome. go/ links are not compatible with other browsers.

To use go/links on your computer we need to create a new profile within Chrome that is signed into your Block account.

So open Chrome and click on the __profile__ icon in the top right.

Select __+ Add__ on the little window that comes up

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-02.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-02.png" %}

On the next screen select __Sign in__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-03.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-03.png" %}

Enter your __DUO__ login information

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-04.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-04.png" %}

Select an __Authentication Method__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-05.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-05.png" %}

You __may__ see the next window, if you do select __Continue__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-06.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-06.png" %}

On the next screen select __Create__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-07.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-07.png" %}

Then choose __Yes, I’m in__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-08.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-08.png" %}

Once you have done that it will open a new Chrome window. If you click on the profile icon again you will see the new profile added.

{% include chromeext.md %}
