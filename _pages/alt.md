We are sorry we were unable to get you an official laptop before your start date. But let's at least get some things setup using an alternate laptop. If you __have received__ your Square laptop, you __must__ follow the [official enrollment](/os) path instead.

## Incognito

Power up an alternate laptop and connect using any method to the Internet. To make sure we keep your personal life separate from this setup process, please switch into "incognito" or "private browsing" mode using one of these methods:

* for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464){:target="_blank"}
** on Mac, press CMD-SHIFT-N
** on Windows/Linux/ChromeOS, press CTRL-SHIFT-N
* for [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history){:target="_blank"}
** on Mac, press CMD-SHIFT-P
** on Windows/Linux, press CTRL-SHIFT-P
* for [Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-private-browsing-ibrw1069/mac){:target="_blank"}, press CMD-SHIFT-N

Once you see an indication (usually a black background) that you have entered incognito/private mode, you may continue.

## Duo Enrollment

We use Duo for single sign-on (SSO), so we need to set that up first. It's a good idea to spend 97 seconds to watch this quick video overview:

{% include video id="22HGUqMMySc" provider="youtube" %}

Now, visit __gmail.com__ and enter your assigned Square email address (e.g., "johnsmith@squareup.com"). 
Then, click [Next](#duo){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="duo"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-login2.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-login2.jpg" caption="(this is the Duo Single Sign-On service you will encounter daily)" %}

Enter just your username (**without the** @squareup.com) and your __temporary__ password and click [Login](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="login"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup1.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup1.jpg" caption="(if you do not see these options, ask for [help](/help))" %}

Click [Start Setup](#setup2){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup2"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup2.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup2.jpg" %}

Choose **Mobile phone** and click [Continue](#setup3){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup3"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup3.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup3.jpg" %}

Enter your **phone number** and click [Continue](#setup4){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup4"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup4.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup4.jpg" %}

Choose your phone type and click [Continue](#setup5){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup5"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup5.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup5.jpg" %}

Install the __Duo Mobile__ app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827){:target="_blank"} or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile){:target="_blank"}.

Then, click [I have Duo Mobile installed](#setup6){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup6"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup6.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup6.jpg" %}

Open the __Duo Mobile__ app on your phone, tap the __+__, and aim your phone at the QR code. 

Once the code is scanned, you may click [Continue](#setup7){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup7"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup7.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup7.jpg" %}

Click [Continue to Login](#setup8){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="setup8"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-setup8.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-setup8.jpg" %}

Click [Send Me a Push](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="push"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" %}

On your mobile device, tap [Approve](#approve){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} when prompted, as shown below:

<a name="approve"></a>
{% include figure url="https://guide.duo.com/static/images/en/android-push-full_2x.png" image_path="https://guide.duo.com/static/images/en/android-push-full_2x.png" %}

If successful, you should now see your Gmail inbox. Gee, how many emails do you _already_ have?
