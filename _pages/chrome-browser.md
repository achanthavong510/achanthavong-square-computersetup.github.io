Open the Chrome browser by clicking the Chrome icon in the center of the dock.

{% include chromeext.md %}

## Fix DNS errors

Let’s now switch to one of Google’s public name servers:

* Ensure your Chromebook is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
* At the bottom right, select the time.
* Select the Wi-Fi Network.
* From the drop-down menu, select your wireless network name.
* Select Network.
* In the "Name servers" section, select Google name servers.
* Optional: If you have another server you'd prefer to use, you can choose Custom name servers and enter your DNS server address.
