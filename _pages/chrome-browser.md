## Fix DNS errors

If you see a DNS (Domain Name System) error, try switching to one of Googleâ€™s public name servers:

* Make sure your Chromebook is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
* At the bottom right, select the time.
* Select the Wi-Fi Network .
* From the drop-down menu, select your wireless network name.
* Select Network.
* In the "Name servers" section, select Google name servers.
* Optional: If you have another server you'd prefer to use, you can choose Custom name servers and enter your DNS server address.
