Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tunnel that creates a private connection between your device and some other network. You may have used this heavily at other jobs, but there are very few services that require VPN at Square. No Customer Success tools require the VPN and even members of IT rarely use the VPN.  The wireless networks in the offices use certificates issued by the VPN to allow you to connect, so it's still a good idea to set things up even if you don't need to access the VPN.

Start by clicking on the clock in the bottom-right corner of your desktop to open the control panel, then click on the __VPN__ icon:

From the network list under __Pulse Secure__, click on __Square Remote Onboard__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/vpn-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/vpn-login.jpg" %}

Enter just your username (jsmith not jsmith@squareup.com) and your password. Then, click __Continue__.

If successful, open up the Chrome web browser and in the address bar at the top, enter __go/vpnsetup__. You will be prompted for your username and password one more time.
