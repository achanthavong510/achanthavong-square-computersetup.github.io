_Let's get your ChromeOS device setup!_

Press the __power__ button at the top-right corner of the keyboard: 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/pixelbookgo-power.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/pixelbookgo-power.jpg" caption="(if you have a ChromeBox the power button is on the device and not the keyboard)" %}

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Square office) with Internet access.

Once booted, your device should indicate that it is __Managed by squareup.com__ (if you do not see this, [ask for help](/help)):

{% include figure url="/assets/images/chrome-01-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/chrome-01-login.jpg" caption="(if you do not see &quot;Managed by squareup.com&quot; ask for [help](/help))" %}
