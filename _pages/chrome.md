_Let's get your ChromeOS device setup!_

Press the __power__ button at the top-right corner of the keyboard: 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/pixelbookgo-power.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/pixelbookgo-power.jpg" caption="(if you have a ChromeBox the power button is on the device and not the keyboard)" %}

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Square office) with Internet access.

Your device should indicate that it is __Managed by squareup.com__:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/chrome-01-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/chrome-01-login.jpg" caption="(if you do not see &quot;Managed by squareup.com&quot; ask for [help](/help))" %}

Enter your full email address (jsmith@squareupcom) and click [Next](#duo){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="duo"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-login.jpg" caption="(this is the Duo Single Sign-On service you will encounter daily)" %}

Enter just your username (jsmith) and your password and click [Login](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

<a name="push"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" caption="(if you do not see these options, ask for [help](/help))" %}

Choose one of the authentication methods, such as sending a push notice to your mobile app. Once authenticated, you should see this success message:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/chrome-02-signin.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/chrome-02-signin.jpg" caption="(you may review the sync options after setup)" %}

Click [Accept and Continue](#ready){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}. You may hear the _Google Assistant_ announce verbally that it has been disabled. You can press the mute button (above the 0 in the top row on your keyboard) to silence the device audio. 

<a name="ready"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/chrome-03-ready.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/chrome-03-ready.jpg"  %}

When you see the __Ready!__ display, you can click [Get Started](/chrome101){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

[Next Step &rarr;](/chrome101){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
