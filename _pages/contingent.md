## 🎉 Welcome
Welcome to Square! Let's get you setup so you can get to work right away. First, some ground rules:

* On Day 1, instructions will be sent to your personal email to set your initial password to your corporate login early in the morning.
* You will not be able to begin this process until you have recieved this email.
* You can optionally join IT Office Hours to get technical support from a member of our IT Team if you run into any questions. The Google Meet link for this onboarding session will be provided to you via onboarding communications.

## 📱 Before you start!
Before starting you will want to download the ![Duo Mobile](/assets/images/duo-icon.png) __Duo Mobile__ app from your phone's App Store. We will use this app for our 2 Factor Authentication. 

Note: This is __not__ the Google Duo app.


## 💻 Laptop in hand?
With the lingering effects of the pandemic, there may be a delay in getting a laptop to you before your start date. Have you received your official Square laptop and have it with you?
