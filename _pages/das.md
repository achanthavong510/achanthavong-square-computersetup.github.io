Square runs a __Device Attestation Service__ (DAS) that asks your device to present a certificate (like a passport when you enter a country) proving it is an authorized and Square-owned device. Next, try accessing the restricted __go/it__ link.

If your device's certificate is properly issued and valid, you should see the __IT Help Center__ shown above. This is where you would submit any help requests (called "tickets") should you have issues in the future. If everything seems to be working, [skip to the bottom](#done) of this page.

If you see __We're having trouble identifying your device__, it means your device did not present a valid certificate. Please join the new hire onboarding session or email Mission Control to get this resolved. Note: Please include the serial number of your laptop.

If you see __Looks like your device needs some maintenance__, it means your device has a valid certificate, but needs updates to the operating system. You may run the updates later and skip forward to the next step as software updates may take some time to install.
