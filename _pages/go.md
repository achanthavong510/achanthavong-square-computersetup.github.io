Square has a handy shared bookmark system that makes use of __go/example__ links (swap in different bookmark names in place of "example"). There are a number of very helpful __go/__ links that you will use often. We'll provide a handy list to get you started later in this setup. First, we need to do a one-time setup. Start by clicking the __Chrome__ web browser icon in the system tray at the bottom. 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/go-links.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/go-links.jpg" %}

In the address bar at the top, type in __go/go__ but do __NOT__ press enter on your keyboard. You'll notice that you have two auto-complete suggestions from the web browser. Using the cursor, click on the option that does __NOT__ say "Google Search". In the future, __go/example__ links will use the bookmark service.

__NOTE:__ You may be prompted to authenticate to Duo SSO again. You may check the box that says __Remember me for 12 hours__ to avoid authenticating more than once daily.

If things worked properly, you should see our internal __Wiki__ site (our intranet). This is a great resource for all Squares, but especially for new Squares. If instead you landed at the Google search results for the popular all-female rock band [The Go-Go's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Go-Go%27s) something went wrong.
