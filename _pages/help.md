This setup guide is designed to be self-contained, but sometimes we all need a helping hand. If you already have access to Slack, visit the [#itsupport](https://square.slack.com/archives/C02AWR2U5) channel to ask for further assistance. 

New hires: join your scheduled __IT Onboarding Session__ on your start date and a member of IT support will be ready to assist.
