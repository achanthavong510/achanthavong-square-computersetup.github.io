This setup guide is intended for workers employed by Square. If you're a Square customer, you should visit the [Help Center](https://squareup.com/help/) instead.

## 🎉 Congratulations
Welcome to Square! Let's get you setup so you can get to work right away. First, some ground rules:

* If you are a new Square, you can not start this guide until your official first day of work.
* It is __very important__ that you do not skip ahead as you may miss some important steps that will cause issues in the future
* Use the sidebar navigation or your back button to visit previous steps
* If you need further assistance, click the [Help](/help) link in the top navigation

## 💻 Laptop in hand?
With the lingering effects of the pandemic, there may be a delay in getting a laptop to you before your start date. Have you received your official Square laptop and have it with you?
