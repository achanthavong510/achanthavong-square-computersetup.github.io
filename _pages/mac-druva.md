We use __Druva__ to continuously backup your Macbook to the cloud, just to be safe. Let's activate it now.

Start by clicking on the Druva icon near the Pulse Secure icon in the top-right corner of your Macbook desktop.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" %}

Click on __Activate Backup__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" %}

Enter your full email address and click [Continue](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" %}

Chrome will launch and open to __cloud.druva.com__. This should automatically activate your account (if you have not recently performed a Duo SSO login, you'll be prompted to do so). 

When the __Open InSync?__ pop-up appears, click [Open InSync](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" %}

The Druva window will come back to the foreground. __DO NOT__ click any buttons.

If you are asked, click [Replace an Existing Device](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac1.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac1.jpg" %}

If this is your first Square laptop, [skip this section](). If you are replacing an existing Square laptop, click [Restore Now](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac2.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac2.jpg" %}

Using the checkboxes, select whether to restore just your data (recommended) or data plus settings. Then click [Restore](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

You may close the Druva window and the restore process (if any) will continue in the background. 

That wasn't so hard, right? Now your Macbook is protected against any accidental data corruption or physical theft.
