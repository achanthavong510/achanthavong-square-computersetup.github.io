We use __Druva__ to continuously backup your Macbook to the cloud, just to be safe. Let's activate it now.

Start by clicking on the Druva icon near the Pulse Secure icon in the top-right corner of your Macbook desktop.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" %}

Click on __Activate Backup__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" %}

Enter your full email address and click [Continue](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" %}

Chrome will launch and open to __cloud.druva.com__. This should automatically activate your account (if you have not recently performed a Duo SSO login, you'll be prompted to do so). 

When the __Open InSync?__ pop-up appears, click [Open InSync](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" %}

The Druva window will come back to the foreground. __DONT__ click any buttons until it finishes logging you in.

If this is your first Square laptop, you can __close__ the Druva window go to the next step. Otherwise click the button to restore your backup from your old Square laptop.
