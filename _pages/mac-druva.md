We use __Druva__ to continuously backup your MacBook to the cloud, just to be safe. Let’s check to see if it is activated now.

Start by clicking on the Druva icon near the Pulse Secure icon in the top-right corner of your MacBook desktop.

If you see either of the below menus, Druva has been activated and you can [Restore Druva Backup &rarr;](/mac-druva-restore/){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large} or [Next Step &rarr;](/mac-yubikey/){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac4.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac4.jpg" %}

If you see “__Activate Backup…__” continue below

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-mac-tray.jpg" %}

Click on __Activate Backup__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-activate.jpg" %}

Enter your full email address and click [Continue](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-login.jpg" %}

Chrome will launch and open to __cloud.druva.com__. This should automatically activate your account (if you have not recently performed an Okta login, you'll be prompted to do so). 

When the __Open InSync?__ pop-up appears, click [Open InSync](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/druva-sso.jpg" %}

The Druva window will come back to the foreground. __DON'T__ click any buttons until it finishes logging you in.

If this is your first Block laptop, you can __close__ the Druva window and go to the next step. Otherwise, click the button to restore your backup from your old Block laptop.
