Let's make sure your Mac Operating System (OS) is up-to-date.


From the Apple menu ï£¿ in the corner of your screen, choose __System Settings__ or __System Preferences__

If you chose __System Settings__, click __General__ on the left side of the window. Then click __Software Update__ on the right.

If you chose __System Preferences__, click __Software Update__ in the window.

Software Update then checks for new software. 

If Software Update finds new software, click the button to install it. The button might be named Update Now, Upgrade Now, Install Now, or Restart Now, for example. You might then be asked to enter your laptop password.
