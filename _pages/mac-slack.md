Here at Block, we use __Slack__ for instant messaging (chat) to enable quick communication within your team and across the company. 

We have several "workspaces" focused on each business unit, but everyone can switch between the workspaces. Some channels are universal and appear in all workspaces (noted with an infinity symbol). Other channels are local to a specific workspace.

First let's open the Slack app by searching using __Spotlight__ in the top right corner.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-slack-downloads.png" image_path="/assets/images/mac-slack-downloads.png" %}

Click [OK](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} to give Slack access to your __Downloads__ folder when prompted.

{% include slackapp.md %}
