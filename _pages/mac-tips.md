__Block VPN__

Some teams at Block require the use of a VPN. Generally this is only for Software Engineers and limited other roles. For example if you are in Sales or Customer Support you won't need to use the VPN. To learn how to connect to the VPN click this link here: [macOS VPN](/mac-vpn/)

Apple has a great guide on how to get started with a Mac here: [MacBook Essentials](https://support.apple.com/guide/macbook-pro/welcome/2020/mac)

At Block we like to make sure all our computers are up to date for the latest features and security patches. If you need to learn how to update, use this guide from Apple: [How to update the software on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201541)
