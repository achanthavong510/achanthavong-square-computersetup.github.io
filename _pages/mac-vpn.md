A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a private connection between your device and another network. Let's go ahead and get our VPN set up on your device.

The Cloudflare WARP VPN is already installed on your MacBook. Select the Cloudflare WARP icon <img src="/assets/images/Cloudfare-WARP.png" width='25' height='5' /> near the clock in the top-right corner of your MacBook.

__Note:__ You will be prompted to authenticate via Okta the first time you use Cloudflare WARP. After authenticating, Cloudflare WARP will automatically connect when you log on for the day.

As long as it says __Connected__, you're all set!
