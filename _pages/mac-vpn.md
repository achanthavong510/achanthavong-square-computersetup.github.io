Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tunnel that creates a private connection between your device and some other network. You may have used this heavily at other jobs, but there are very few services that require VPN at Block. No Customer Success tools require the VPN and even members of IT rarely use the VPN.  The wireless networks in the offices use certificates issued by the VPN to allow you to connect, so it's still a good idea to set things up even if you don't need to access the VPN.

â€œThe Cloudflare WARP VPN is already installed on your Mac. Select the Cloudflare WARP icon <img src="/assets/images/Cloudfare-WARP.png" width='25' height='5' /> near the clock in the top-right corner of your Macbook.

__Note:__ You will be prompted to authenticate via Okta the first time you use Cloudflare WARP.  After authenticating, Cloudflare WARP will automatically connect when you log on for the day.

As long as it says __Connected__, you're all set!
