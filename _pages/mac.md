Let's get your Macbook setup!

Press the __power__ button at the top-right corner of the keyboard: 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" caption="(if you have a Mac Mini, the power button is in the rear)" %}

Shortly after boot-up, you will be asked to select your home and preferred language:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-02-locale.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-02-locale.jpg"  %}

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Square office) with Internet access.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-03-wifi.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-03-wifi.jpg"  %}

Next, some Mac devices will show a __Remote Management__ screen indicating it is managed by __Square Inc.__:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-04-remote.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-04-remote.jpg" %}

Other Mac devices will show a __Data &amp; Privacy__ screen instead:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-05-privacy.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-05-privacy.jpg" %}

Click [Remote Management](/mac-mgmt){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} or [Data &amp; Privacy](/mac-privacy){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} for the next set of instructions.
