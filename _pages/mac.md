Let's get your MacBook set up!

Press the __power__ button at the top-right corner of the keyboard:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" caption="(if you have a Mac Mini, the power button is in the rear)" %}

Shortly after boot-up, you will be asked to select your home, any accessability options you may require and preferred language:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-02-locale-BigSur.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-02-locale-BigSur.jpg"  %}

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Square Guest network in a Block Office).

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-03-wifiBigSur.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-03-wifiBigSur.jpg"  %}
