Since we have go/ links working, let's reset your Square password. In your browser navigate to go/password

{% include figure url="/assets/images/password.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/password.jpg" %}

Enter your Square username and click Submit.

Next, reset your password. It will prompt you for your “Old Password”, enter in the temp password on the Welcome Sheet and enter a new
password that meets the password requirements.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/-reset-password.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/reset-password.jpg" %}

That’s it all set!
