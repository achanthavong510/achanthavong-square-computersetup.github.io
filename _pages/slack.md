Squares make use of __Slack__ for instant messaging (chat) to enable quick communication within your team and across the company. Start the Chrome web browser (usually located in the system tray at the bottom). Type __go/slack__ in the address bar at the top.

Click on __Sign in with Duo Access Gateway__ which should redirect you to Duo SSO where you can sign in with your Square username and Password. If you haven't used Slack before, please browse the [Slack quick start guide](https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/your-quick-start-guide-to-slack){:target="_blank"}.

You may be prompted to __Enable Desktop Notifications__:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" %}

These notifications will take the form of brief pop-ups in the corner of your screen. Click to allow notifications so that you don't miss any incoming messages.

As you'll interact with Slack on a daily basis, we recommend you __Pin__ Slack so that it is always available. Right-click on the web page tab at the top and select __Pin tab__, as illustrated below:

Some people like having Slack in a separate application window instead of in their browsers. You can install a separate Slack app for [MacOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack/id803453959?ls=1&mt=12){: target="_blank" }, [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows){: target="_blank" }, or [ChromeOS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slack/jeogkiiogjbmhklcnbgkdcjoioegiknm?hl=en-US){: target="_blank" } -- but fair warning that it is just another mini-web browser in its own window. You will not have any additional functionality.
