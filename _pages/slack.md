Squares make use of __Slack__ for instant messaging (chat) to enable quick communication within your team and across the company. Start the Chrome web browser (usually located in the system tray at the bottom). Type __go/slack__ in the address bar at the top.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/slack-login.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/slack-login.jpg" %}

Click on __Sign in with Google__ which should redirect you to Duo SSO and then immediately redirect you to Slack. You may be prompted to __Enable Desktop Notifications__:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/slack-notify-ask.jpg" %}

These notifications will take the form of brief pop-ups in the corner of your screen. Click to allow notifications so that you don't miss any incoming messages.

As you'll interact with Slack on a daily basis, we recommend you __Pin__ Slack so that it is always available. Right-click on the web page tab at the top and select __Pin tab__, as illustrated below:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/pin-tab-chrome.gif" image_path="/assets/images/pin-tab-chrome.gif" %}

When you're ready, choose the corresponding next step button below:
