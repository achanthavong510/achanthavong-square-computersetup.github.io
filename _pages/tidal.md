## Delayed Laptops
With the lingering effects of the pandemic, there may be a delay in getting a laptop to you before your start date. 

If you have __NOT__ received your Square laptop, we will have a __required__ IT onboarding session via Google Meet to assist you. You will receive an invitation to this session at your Tidal.com email account.

## üíª Laptop in hand?
If you have received your Square laptop, __DO NOT TURN IT ON until May 3rd__ (but charging the battery is okay).
