Now lets open Chrome, the icon will be on your Windows Desktop. (If it isn't there right away, wait a minute or two!)

We will first sign into your Block email address. Enter __gmail.com__ in the address bar.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" %}

Now sign into Gmail using the email provided on your Welcome Sheet. You will then be redirected to a Duo SSO login.

{% include duosetup.md %}

Now you should be logged in and Google may ask you to accept the terms and conditions as well as set up the look for your Gmail inbox.

Next, we will sign-in to Google Chrome to link it to Square's Google Workplace (formerly "GSuite").

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-sync.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-sync.png"  %}

Click on the person icon in the top-right corner of the Chrome browser, then click [Turn on sync...](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png"  %}

When prompted to sync your browser with Square's Google services, click on [Link Data](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png"  %}

Click on [Yes I'm in](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} to confirm a sync with Square's Google services.

{% include chromeext.md %}

[Next Step &rarr;](/win-go/){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
