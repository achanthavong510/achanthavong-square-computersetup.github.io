## Signing into Google Chrome

Now let’s open Google Chrome. The icon should be on your Windows Desktop. If it isn’t there right away, wait a minute or two.

* Open Google Chrome from the desktop.
* Click Sign In and enter your email.

* A prompt will appear asking you to “Turn on Sync.” Click Yes, I’m in. This is important to enable as it will download the necessary Chrome extensions for using go/links and other internal tools.
