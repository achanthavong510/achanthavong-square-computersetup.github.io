Now lets open Chrome, the icon will be on your Windows Desktop. (If it isn't there right away, wait a minute or two!)

We will first sign into your Square email address. Enter __gmail.com__ in the address bar.

Now sign into Gmail using the email provided on your Welcome Sheet. 

<a name="gmail"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" %}

You will then be prompted for a username and password.

Enter just your username (**without the** @squareup.com) and your temporary password and click [Login](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}
Note: Click the small x if asked to save your password, we can save it later after we change it.

If you have set up Duo previously, skip forward to the send a push section below.

<a name="duo"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-duo.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-duo.png" %}

Click [Start Setup](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} and go through the whole process.

* Choose **Mobile phone**
* Enter **Phone Number**
* Choose **phone type**
* Select **I have Duo Mobile installed**
* Open **Duo Mobile app on your phone and Click the +**
* Scan **QR Code**
* Select **Continue to Login**
* Click on [Send Me a Push](#push){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}
* Approve **Push notification on your phone**

<a name="push"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/duo-push.jpg" caption="(if you do not see these options, ask for [help](/help))" %}

Now you should be logged in and Google may ask you to accept the terms and conditions as well as set up the look for your Gmail inbox.

Next, we will sign-in to Google Chrome to link it to Square's Google Workplace (formerly "GSuite").

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-sync.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-sync.png"  %}

Click on the person icon in the top-right corner of the Chrome browser, then click [Turn on sync...](#synced){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png"  %}

When prompted to sync your browser with Square's Google services, click on [Link Data](#link){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

<a name="link"></a> 
{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png"  %}

Click on [Yes I'm in](#yes){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} to confirm a sync with Square's Google services.

<a name="yes"></a> 
Within a minute, you will see some mandatory Chrome extensions installed in the puzzle icon in the top-right corner of Google Chrome.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-extension.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-extension.png" caption="(if no Square logo appears within two minutes, enter __chrome://restart__ in the address bar, press enter, and wait a few more minutes)" %}

Once you see the Square Go Links extension, your Chrome web browser is properly configured and ready for use.
