__Setting Up Chrome__

Now let's open Chrome. The icon will be on your Windows Desktop. If it isn't there right away, wait a minute or two!

First, we will first sign into your Block email address. Enter __gmail.com__ in the address bar.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-gmail.png" %}

Sign into Gmail using your Block email address. You will then be redirected to a Okta login.

Once logged in, Google may ask you to accept the terms and conditions and set up the look for your Gmail inbox.

Next, we will sign-in to Google Chrome to link it to Block's Google Workplace (formerly "GSuite").

Click on the person icon in the top-right corner of the Chrome browser, then click [Turn on sync...](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-link.png"  %}

When prompted to sync your browser with Block's Google services, click on [Link Data](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-chrome-yes.png"  %}

Click on [Yes I'm in](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} to confirm a sync with Block's Google services.

{% include chromeext.md %}

[Next Step &rarr;](/win-go/){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}
