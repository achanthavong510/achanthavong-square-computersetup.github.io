# Druva Setup

We use __Druva__ to continuously backup your computer to the cloud, just to be safe. Let's activate it now.

1.	Start by clicking the Druva inSync icon on the desktop.

2.	Enter your username ending in @squareup.com and click Continue (This will not work with a @tidal.com or @block.xyz domain. You must use @squareup.com.)

3.	Google Chrome and Okta will launch a “Windows Security” prompt. Enter the PIN you set up earlier.

5. The Druva window will come back to the foreground. DO NOT click any buttons.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-druva-replace.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-druva-replace.png" %}

7. If this is your first Block laptop, [skip this section](#done). If you are replacing an existing Block laptop, click [Restore Now](#restore){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

<a name="restore"></a>
{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-druva-restore.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-druva-restore.png" %}

Using the checkboxes, select whether to restore just your data (recommended) or data plus settings. Then click [Restore](#done){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.
