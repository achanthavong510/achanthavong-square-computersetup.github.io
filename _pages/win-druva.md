# Druva Setup

We use __Druva__ to continuously backup your computer to the cloud, just to be safe. Let's activate it now.

* Start by clicking the Druva inSync icon on the desktop.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-druva-restore.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-druva-restore.png" %}

* Using the checkboxes, select whether to restore just your data (recommended) or data plus settings. Then click [Restore](#done){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

You may close the Druva window and the restore process (if any) will continue in the background.
