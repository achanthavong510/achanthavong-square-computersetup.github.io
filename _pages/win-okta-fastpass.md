Let's set up __Okta Fastpass__. 

__Okta FastPass__ provides a quick, easy, and secure way to sign in and helps protect you from phishing.

First, make sure that you have Bluetooth enabled on __both your Windows machine and on your mobile device__. 
To confirm this on your Windows machine, click on the Control Center icon in the bottom-right corner.
Then confirm Bluetooth is also enabled on your mobile device.
