First turn on your new laptop with the __power__ button.

Once it starts up you will eventually get to a screen that asks you to select your country.

Then you will need to choose your keyboard layout.

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Block office) with Internet access.

After connecting to your network the computer may restart. Once it comes back, it's time to log in.

Before continuing, you will need to have been provisioned a Microsoft account by IT. If you haven't got the details for this, please create at ticket at go/IT, or reply to the IT setup email you were sent if it's your first day.

Next you will see a __Welcome to Block, Inc.__ screen.

Here you will need to put in your Block email address. 

If you have never signed in to your Microsoft account you will need to enter your temporary password provided by Block IT.

You will need to set a phone number to recieve your verification SMS's.

You will also be asked to set a new password for your Microsoft account.

If you have signed into your Microsoft account previously, you will instead need to put in your password and enter the verification code that will be sent via SMS.

Note: This password may be different than your Block password.

After logging in, you will need to accept some terms and conditions. Your computer will continue setting up and may restart again. Eventually, you will see a screen that says Setting up your Device for Work.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-setup.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-setup.png" %}

Once the setup gets to __Device Setup__, a __Continue Anyway__ button will appear on the lower right of the screen. You may choose to click __Continue Anyway__ instead of waiting for the setup to finish.

Next, you will be asked to __Use Windows Hello__ with your account. Press __Okay__ and then enter the verification code that will be sent via SMS to your phone.

After a few moments, you will be able to setup __Use your Fingerprint__ or choose __Skip for now__ if you don't want to use biometrics. Fingerprint is more preferred than facial recognition.

Next, you will be asked to __Set up a PIN__. Setting up a PIN is required. The PIN will be the password you use to log into the computer; it must be at least 8 characters long, and if you want to use letters you will need to check the box to allow it!

You can then click __OK__ on the next screen to be taken to the desktop!
