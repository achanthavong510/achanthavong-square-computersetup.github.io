First turn on your new laptop with the __power__ button.

Once it starts up you will eventually get to a screen that asks you to select your country.

Then you will need to choose your keyboard layout.

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Block office) with Internet access.

After connecting to your network the computer may restart. Once it comes back, it's time to log in.

Next you will see a __Let's get things set up__ screen.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-get-setup.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-get-setup.png" %}

Here you will need to put in your Block email address. 

Then, you'll sign in with Okta, and set up 2FA.
{% include duosetup.md %}

After logging in, you will need to accept some terms and conditions. Your computer will continue setting up and may restart again. Eventually, you will see a screen that says Setting up for work or school.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-setup.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-setup.png" %}

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-sign-in.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-sign-in.png" %}

Sign in with your username and password.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-okta-popup.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-okta-popup.png" %}

You may see an Okta login screen here, if you do, sign in using your email address and password.

Once the setup retuns to __Setting up for work or school__, a __Continue Anyway__ button will appear on the lower right of the screen. You may choose to click __Continue Anyway__ instead of waiting for the setup to finish.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-hello.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-hello.png" %}

Next, you will be asked to __Use Windows Hello__ with your account. Press __Okay__ and then enter the verification code that will be sent via SMS to your phone.

After a few moments, you will be able to setup __Use your Fingerprint__ or choose __Skip for now__ if you don't want to use biometrics. Fingerprint is more preferred than facial recognition.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/win-pin.png" image_path="/assets/images/win-pin.png" %}

Next, you will be asked to __Set up a PIN__. Setting up a PIN is required. The PIN will be the password you use to log into the computer; it must be at least 8 characters long, and if you want to use letters you will need to check the box to allow it!

You can then click __OK__ on the next screen to be taken to the desktop!
