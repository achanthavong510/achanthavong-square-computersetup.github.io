Once it starts up you will eventually get to a screen that asks you to select your country.

Then you will need to choose your keyboard layout.

And then you will need to connect to your Wifi network. Find your home network, enter your password and click Next.

If you are in a Square office, select Square Guest. The password is: fieldinternet 

After connecting to your network the computer may restart, once it comes back its time to log in.

Before continuing you will need to have been provisioned a Microsoft account by IT. If you haven't got the details for this please reach out to us on slack at #itsupport.

Next you will see a Welcome to Square, Inc. screen.

Here you will need to put in your Square email address. 

If you have never signed in you will need to enter your temporary password and set a phone number for future verification, you will also be asked to set a new password for your Microsoft account.

If you have signed into your microsoft account previously you will then need to put in your password and enter the verification code that will be sent via SMS.

Note: This password may be different than your Square password.

After logging in the computer will continue setting up and may restart again and eventually you will see a screen that says Setting up your device for work

You will want to wait on this screen until Device Preparation and Device Setup both have a green check and say Complete.
