First turn on your new laptop with the __power__ button.

Once it starts up you will eventually get to a screen that asks you to select your country.

Then you will need to choose your keyboard layout.

Connect your device to a wireless network (either your home WiFi or the Square office) with Internet access.

After connecting to your network the computer may restart, once it comes back its time to log in.

Before continuing you will need to have been provisioned a Microsoft account by IT. If you haven't got the details for this please reach out to us on slack at #itsupport or reply to the IT setup email you were sent if it's your first day.

Next you will see a __Welcome to Square, Inc.__ screen.

Once the setup gets to __Device Setup__, a __Continue Anyway__ button will appear on the lower right of the screen. You may choose to click __Continue Anyway__ instead of waiting for the setup to finish.

After a few moments you will be able to setup __Use your Fingerprint__ or choose __Skip for now__ if you don't want to use biometrics. Fingerprint is more preferred than facial recognition.

Next you will be asked to __Set up a PIN__, setting up a PIN is required. The PIN will be the password you use to log into the computer; it must be at least 8 characters long and if you want to use letters you will need to check the box to allow it!
