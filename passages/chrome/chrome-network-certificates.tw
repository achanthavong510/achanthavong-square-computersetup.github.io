When prompted enter just your username (jsmith not jsmith@squareup.com) and your Block password. Then, click ''Continue''. This may take up to 30 seconds

If successful, open the Chrome browser and go to ''go/vpnsetup''

Once the page loads, again enter your username and Block password and click ''Let's Go!''

After a few minutes, you will see a success message that says ''Device Provisioning Complete''. Click on the clock and go to the VPN icon in the control panel again

Click on the ''Disconnect'' button. Now to test that your provisioning works on an actual VPN and not just the special onboarding VPN, select the ''Square VPN AWS''

You will be prompted to select the certificate to use to authenticate - as you only have one, select it and then click ''OK''

Next, enter just your Block password for a Secondary Credential (the username will be disabled)

If all goes according to plan, you have now confirmed that you have provisioned a certificate for VPN and in-office WiFi. Finally, you should go back and disconnect from the //Square AWS VPN// as we wont need it to continue.
