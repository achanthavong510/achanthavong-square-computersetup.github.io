Now we have to do some extra steps to get your MacBook enrolled with our Mobile Device Management (MDM) system

First, you will need to open Safari. It should be located in the Dock along the bottom (with a blue compass icon)

Now let's type ''newcomputer.square.com/mdmfix.pkg'' into the address bar in Safari to download the MDM Fix Installer

Once the download completes, open the file out of your downloads folder in the Dock

Click on ''Continue'' a few times and then ''Install'' in the package installation display. You may be prompted for your ''Laptop Password'' to allow the installation to continue

If there are no errors during installation, you will see a notification appear in the top-right corner of your screen within the next 2 minutes (near the time)

If you do see the notification, click ''Allow'' to authorize the device enrollment. You will be prompted for your laptop password and then to login with Duo
<<if $firstLaptop is true>>
<<include [[Duo New]]>>
<<else>>
<<include [[Duo Login]]>>

>You wont be able to use your YubiKey at this screen, so please use ''Send a Push''
<</if>>
After several seconds, you should see a //Device Manager// display showing that your device has been verified.

As you didn't get the notification, we can use another method to try enroll your device
<<if $firstLaptop is true>>
First we are going to log into //Slack// to setup //Duo Multi Factor Authentication//

>We wont complete the setup of Slack in this step, we will come back to it later

In Safari you will need to go to ''square.enterprise.slack.com'' where you will be prompted to set up Duo

<<include [[Duo New]]>>

After approving the push we can continue on now that Duo is set up
<</if>>
In Safari you will need to go to this website ''go.sqprod.co/mdmold''

Once you get there you will be prompted to log in using Duo. Enter your login information and ''Send a Push'' when prompted

After logging in you will be presented with a screen asking you to //Enable Device Management//. Click on ''Redirect and Enable''

When prompted by Safari to allow downloads, click ''Allow''

macOS will prompt you with a notification for //Profile Installation//. You will need to open ''System Preferences'' to complete the installation. You can find System Preferences by clicking the ''Apple logo'' in the top left corner of the screen

<div class="small-image">[img[images/mac/mac-review-profile.png]]</div>
